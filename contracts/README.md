Introducing Visor NFT vault. 

- Visor is a living Smart Vault platform, built as a compatibility layer within the emerging DeFi ecosystem and integrating the UniversalVault standard being developed by the [Alchemist](alchemist.wtf) project.

- Visor's factory allows for community governance of updates and extensions to the VisorNFT without breaking compatilibilty across rewards platforms.

- New UniversalVault contract templates can be chosen for minting via VisorFactory's createSelected method.  
- Use Visor.sol as a base and submit your template proposals for admission at [snapshot.org/#/visor.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/visor.eth)

Stay tuned for more to come!
